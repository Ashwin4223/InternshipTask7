     - **🚫 Inject ads or malware:** Display unwanted ads or even install malware on your system.
     - **🔐 Hijack sessions:** Intercept secure sessions (like banking) and steal credentials.
     - **🤖 Take over your browser:** Modify your browser settings, redirect you to phishing sites, or prevent you from removing them.
   - **Pro Tip:** Always cross-check the extension's developer, reviews, and update history before installing or trusting it.
